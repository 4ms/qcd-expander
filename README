## QCD Expander firmware ##

This is the firmware for the QCD Expander. It will work on legacy/kit through-hole versions
as well as current SMT versions.

The ./burn command is a helpful wrapper which sets the fuses and flashes the hex file.

The _5ms hex file is preferred, but the original hex file will work as well.
